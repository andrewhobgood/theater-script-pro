# Security Guidelines for TheaterScript Pro

## Overview

TheaterScript Pro handles sensitive intellectual property and financial transactions requiring multi-layered security. This document establishes comprehensive security protocols for OTP authentication, role-based access control, secure file delivery, and data protection measures essential for protecting playwrights' scripts and theater companies' business data.

## Authentication Security

### OTP Implementation
Implement secure one-time password authentication using Resend for email delivery. Generate cryptographically secure 6-digit codes with 10-minute expiration windows. Store OTP hashes in Supabase with automatic cleanup of expired tokens.

### Session Management
Use Supabase Auth with secure HTTP-only cookies for session tokens. Implement automatic session refresh with sliding expiration. Configure secure cookie attributes including SameSite=Strict and Secure flags for production environments.

### Password Security
Enforce strong password requirements with minimum 12 characters, mixed case, numbers, and special characters. Implement bcrypt hashing with salt rounds of 12 or higher. Provide secure password reset flows with time-limited tokens.

## Role-Based Access Control

### Permission Matrix
Define granular permissions for each role type across all platform features. Playwrights control script visibility, licensing terms, and profile information. Theater Companies access licensed scripts and submit production data. Admins manage platform operations and copyright submissions.

### Middleware Implementation
Create authentication middleware that validates user sessions and role permissions for every protected route. Implement cascade permissions where higher roles inherit lower-level access. Use TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety across permission checks.

### Route Protection
Secure all API routes with role-based middleware validation. Implement server-side checks for data access patterns. Use Supabase RLS policies to enforce database-level security constraints matching application permissions.

## File Security & Intellectual Property Protection

### Secure File Delivery
Generate time-limited signed URLs for all script downloads with maximum 24-hour expiration. Implement user-specific access tokens that prevent URL sharing. Use AWS S3 bucket policies to restrict direct file access and require signed requests.

### Script Access Control
Track all script access attempts with user identification, timestamp, and IP address logging. Implement download limits per licensing agreement. Create audit trails for script viewing and download activities accessible to playwrights.

### Watermarking & DRM
Apply dynamic watermarking to perusal scripts with user information and timestamp. Implement PDF viewer restrictions preventing copy, print, and save operations. Use React PDF viewer with custom controls that disable right-click and keyboard shortcuts.

## Input Validation & Data Protection

### Zod Schema Validation
Create comprehensive Zod schemas for all user inputs including script metadata, licensing terms, and profile information. Implement server-side validation that mirrors client-side checks. Use discriminated unions for role-specific form validation.

### SQL Injection Prevention
Use Supabase's built-in parameterized queries and avoid dynamic SQL construction. Implement input sanitization for all database operations. Apply strict type checking for all database parameters using TypeScript interfaces.

### XSS Protection
Sanitize all user-generated content including script descriptions, playwright bios, and theater company profiles. Use DOMPurify for HTML sanitization in WYSIWYG editors. Implement Content Security Policy headers to prevent script injection.

## Payment Security

### Stripe Integration
Use Stripe's secure payment processing with PCI compliance handled by Stripe. Implement server-side payment intent creation with metadata validation. Never store payment card information in application database.

### Transaction Logging
Log all payment attempts, successes, and failures with user identification and transaction details. Implement webhook signature verification for Stripe events. Create secure audit trails for all financial transactions accessible to relevant parties.

### Licensing Validation
Verify licensing permissions before granting script access. Implement atomic transactions for payment processing and license activation. Use database constraints to prevent unauthorized script access after payment failures.

## Infrastructure Security

### Environment Variables
Store all sensitive configuration in environment variables with proper access controls. Use different encryption keys for development, staging, and production environments. Implement secret rotation policies for API keys and database credentials.

### Rate Limiting
Implement progressive rate limiting for authentication attempts, file downloads, and API requests. Use Redis or similar for distributed rate limiting across multiple server instances. Apply stricter limits for sensitive operations like password resets.

### Monitoring & Alerting
Configure Sentry for real-time error tracking with sensitive data scrubbing. Implement custom alerts for security events including failed login attempts, unusual file access patterns, and payment anomalies. Create automated incident response workflows.

## Compliance & Audit

### Data Retention
Implement data retention policies compliant with intellectual property law and user privacy requirements. Automatically purge expired OTP codes, old session tokens, and temporary file access logs. Maintain permanent audit trails for copyright registrations.

### Privacy Controls
Provide user controls for data visibility and sharing preferences. Implement data export functionality for user account information. Create secure data deletion processes that maintain necessary audit trails while removing personal information.

### Security Testing
Conduct regular penetration testing focusing on authentication flows, file access controls, and payment processing. Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines. Perform quarterly security audits of role-based access controls and data protection measures.

## Implementation Checklist

Apply these security measures systematically across all platform components. Regularly review and update security protocols as new features are added. Maintain security documentation and provide team training on secure coding practices. Test security measures in staging environments before production deployment.
