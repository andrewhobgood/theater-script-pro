# Copyright Registration Service

## Overview

The Copyright Registration Service enables playwrights to register their scripts with the US Copyright Office through TheaterScript Pro's managed submission process. This service handles fee collection, document preparation, status tracking, and confirmation management while maintaining compliance with US Copyright Office requirements.
