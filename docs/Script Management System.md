# Script Management System

## Overview

The Script Management System serves as the core content engine for TheaterScript Pro, handling the complete lifecycle of theatrical scripts from initial upload through search discovery. This system orchestrates secure file storage, metadata management, perusal version handling, and search indexing to ensure optimal script discoverability while maintaining intellectual property protection.

## Core Components

### Upload Management
- **FileUploadHandler**: Processes script files with validation for format, size, and content integrity
- **VersionController**: Manages full scripts and perusal versions with separate access controls
- **MetadataExtractor**: Automatically extracts script information including character counts, page numbers, and formatting details
- **S3Manager**: Handles secure file storage with expiring URLs and role-based access control

### Content Organization
- **ScriptProfileBuilder**: Generates comprehensive script pages with metadata, cast information, and embedded viewers
- **CategoryManager**: Organizes scripts by genre, themes, cast size, and production requirements
- **TaggingSystem**: Implements flexible tagging for advanced filtering and discovery
- **RelationshipMapper**: Links scripts to playwrights, productions, and licensing history

### Search Integration
- **SearchIndexer**: Maintains real-time search indices for script discovery
- **FilterEngine**: Processes complex search queries with multiple criteria
- **RecommendationEngine**: Suggests relevant scripts based on user preferences and search patterns
- **AnalyticsTracker**: Monitors search performance and content engagement

## Implementation Guidelines

### File Upload Process
Implement multi-step upload validation starting with file type verification, followed by content scanning for appropriate theatrical format. Use progressive upload with chunking for large files, ensuring atomic operations that can be safely retried on failure. Store original files in S3 with playwright-specific prefixes and implement immediate backup to secondary storage.

### Metadata Management
Extract comprehensive script metadata including cast breakdown, setting requirements, runtime estimates, and thematic content. Validate all metadata fields using Zod schemas with custom validators for theatrical-specific data like character age ranges and production complexity ratings. Implement versioning for metadata updates to maintain audit trails.

### Perusal Version Handling
Generate perusal versions through automated processing that extracts representative scenes while maintaining dramatic flow. Apply watermarking with playwright information and viewing restrictions. Store perusal versions separately with different access controls and expiration policies. Implement view tracking to monitor engagement without compromising security.

### Search Optimization
Build comprehensive search indices that include script content, metadata, and derived attributes like production difficulty and audience suitability. Implement faceted search with real-time filtering on multiple dimensions. Use full-text search for script content with relevance scoring based on theatrical terminology and industry-specific language patterns.

### Security Considerations
Implement multi-layered security with file scanning, content validation, and access control verification. Use signed URLs for all file access with short expiration times. Apply role-based permissions at both application and storage levels. Implement audit logging for all file operations and access attempts.

### Performance Optimization
Optimize upload performance through parallel processing of validation, storage, and indexing operations. Use CDN distribution for perusal content delivery. Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed metadata and search results. Apply lazy loading for script content and progressive enhancement for viewer functionality.

### Content Workflow
Establish clear content lifecycle management from draft uploads through published availability. Implement approval workflows for quality control and copyright verification. Provide playwright tools for content updates and version management. Enable bulk operations for managing large script collections.

## Integration Points

### Supabase Integration
Leverage Supabase for user authentication, role verification, and relational data storage. Use row-level security for script access control. Implement real-time subscriptions for collaboration features and live updates during upload processing.

### Stripe Integration
Connect script licensing directly to script management for seamless purchase flows. Implement licensing status tracking that updates script availability in real-time. Handle refunds and access revocation through automated workflows.

### AWS S3 Integration
Configure S3 buckets with proper CORS settings for direct uploads. Implement lifecycle policies for automated archival of old versions. Use S3 event notifications to trigger processing workflows and maintain system consistency.

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Standards
Enforce strict validation for script formats, ensuring compatibility with industry-standard theatrical formatting. Validate metadata completeness and accuracy using theatrical industry standards. Implement content scanning for inappropriate material and copyright compliance.

### Error Handling
Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages for common upload issues. Provide detailed error reporting for debugging while maintaining security. Use retry mechanisms for transient failures and graceful degradation for service interruptions.

### Monitoring and Analytics
Track upload success rates, processing times, and user engagement metrics. Monitor search performance and content discovery patterns. Implement alerting for system issues and unusual activity patterns that might indicate security concerns.
