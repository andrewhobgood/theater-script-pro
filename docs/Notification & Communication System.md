## Technical Implementation

### Email Template System
Utilize Resend's template engine with role-specific customization supporting playwright branding, theater company logos, and admin communications. Templates include responsive design for mobile theater professionals and embedded tracking pixels for engagement analytics.

### Queue Management
Implement priority-based email queuing with immediate delivery for OTP and transaction confirmations, scheduled delivery for production reminders, and batch processing for marketing communications. Use Supabase background jobs for queue processing with retry logic and failure handling.

### Personalization Engine
Leverage user behavior data from Supabase to create targeted notification content including script recommendations, licensing opportunities, and production scheduling suggestions. Apply machine learning insights from user interaction patterns to optimize send timing and content relevance.

### Delivery Optimization
Configure Resend with domain authentication for maximum deliverability, implement bounce and complaint handling, and maintain sender reputation through list hygiene. Use A/B testing for subject lines and content optimization specific to theater industry terminology.

## Notification Workflows

### Registration Flow
```
1. User submits registration → 2. Generate OTP → 3. Queue email → 4. Send via Resend
                                     ↓
5. User verifies OTP ← 6. Welcome email ← 7. Role-specific onboarding sequence
```

### Licensing Transaction Flow
```
Stripe Webhook → Transaction Validation → Immediate Confirmation Email
      ↓                    ↓                        ↓
License Activation → Script Access Grant → Follow-up Engagement
```

### Production Reminder Flow
```
Calendar Trigger → User Behavior Check → Personalized Reminder → Engagement Tracking
       ↓                   ↓                     ↓                    ↓
Smart Scheduling → Content Optimization → Delivery Timing → Response Analysis
```

## Security & Compliance

### Data Protection
Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive communications, secure token generation for OTP delivery, and GDPR-compliant unsubscribe mechanisms. Ensure PII protection in email content and maintain audit trails for all notification activities.

### Anti-Spam Measures
Configure rate limiting for notification frequency, implement user preference management for communication types, and maintain suppression lists for bounced addresses. Use double opt-in for marketing communications and honor unsubscribe requests immediately.

### Monitoring & Analytics
Track delivery rates, open rates, and click-through rates with Resend analytics integration. Monitor bounce rates and spam complaints to maintain sender reputation. Implement alerting for delivery failures and queue processing delays.

## Integration Points

### Supabase Integration
Utilize Supabase triggers for real-time notification events, store user communication preferences, and maintain notification history. Implement row-level security for notification access control and use Supabase functions for complex notification logic.

### Stripe Webhook Integration
Process payment events for immediate transaction notifications, handle subscription lifecycle communications, and manage failed payment recovery sequences. Ensure idempotent processing for webhook retries and maintain transaction correlation.

### AWS S3 Integration
Generate secure script access URLs for licensing confirmation emails, create time-limited download links for purchased scripts, and implement access logging for intellectual property protection.

## Performance Optimization

### Batch Processing
Group non-urgent notifications for efficient delivery, implement smart batching based on user time zones, and optimize template rendering for bulk operations. Use background job queuing to prevent blocking user interactions.

### Caching Strategy
Cache frequently used templates and user preferences, implement Redis for session-based notification state, and optimize database queries for notification triggers. Use CDN delivery for email assets and images.

### Scalability Considerations
Design for horizontal scaling with queue distribution, implement circuit breakers for external service failures, and use database connection pooling for high-volume notification processing. Plan for peak usage during licensing seasons and production periods.
