## Licensing Models Implementation

### Standard Commercial Licensing
Implement per-performance pricing with customizable rates set by playwrights. Support flat-rate licensing for specific run lengths and venue capacity-based pricing tiers. Handle advance payments with automated royalty calculations for extended runs.

### Educational Pricing Tiers
Create separate pricing structures for K-12, college, and community theater productions. Implement automatic educational verification through domain checking and manual approval workflows. Support playwright-controlled discount percentages with minimum rate enforcement.

### Subscription Services
Develop tiered subscription models for theater companies with monthly script access quotas. Include premium features like priority support, bulk licensing discounts, and exclusive script previews. Handle prorated billing for mid-cycle plan changes.

## Payment Processing Components

### Stripe Integration Layer
Configure Stripe webhooks for payment confirmation, failed payments, and subscription lifecycle events. Implement secure payment intent creation with metadata tracking for script licensing details. Support multiple payment methods including ACH transfers for large theater companies.

### Invoice Generation System
Generate detailed invoices with script information, licensing terms, and payment breakdowns. Include playwright and theater company details with automated tax calculations where applicable. Support recurring invoice generation for subscription services and extended licensing agreements.

### Payment Status Tracking
Maintain comprehensive payment audit trails with status updates for pending, completed, failed, and refunded transactions. Implement automated retry logic for failed payments with configurable retry intervals. Track partial payments and payment plan fulfillment for large licensing deals.

## Security and Compliance

### PCI Compliance
Never store credit card information directly in the application database. Route all sensitive payment data through Stripe's secure tokenization system. Implement proper SSL/TLS encryption for all payment-related communications with comprehensive logging for security audits.

### Access Control Integration
Link payment confirmation to S3 access URL generation with expiring tokens. Implement role-based payment permissions ensuring only authorized theater company representatives can make licensing purchases. Revoke script access immediately upon payment disputes or chargebacks.

### Fraud Prevention
Implement velocity checking for rapid successive purchases and unusual payment patterns. Integrate with Stripe Radar for machine learning-based fraud detection. Monitor geographic payment patterns and flag suspicious international transactions for manual review.

## Educational Verification System

### Automated Verification
Verify educational status through email domain checking against known educational institutions. Implement automated approval for recognized domains with manual review queues for unrecognized institutions. Support documentation upload for non-standard educational organizations.

### Pricing Override Logic
Apply educational discounts automatically upon verification with playwright-defined minimum rates. Handle mixed pricing for educational productions with professional guest artists. Support time-limited educational rates with automatic expiration and renewal workflows.

## Subscription Management

### Plan Management
Support multiple subscription tiers with different script access limits and feature sets. Implement usage tracking against subscription quotas with overage billing options. Handle plan upgrades and downgrades with immediate or next-cycle billing adjustments.

### Billing Cycle Management
Process recurring billing with automated invoice generation and payment collection. Handle failed subscription payments with dunning management and account suspension protocols. Support annual billing with discount incentives and prorated refunds for cancellations.

## Integration Points

### Database Schema Integration
Link payment records to user profiles, script licenses, and theater company accounts. Maintain payment history with detailed transaction metadata for reporting and analytics. Support complex licensing agreements with multiple payment schedules and terms.

### Notification System Integration
Trigger automated emails for payment confirmations, failed payments, and subscription renewals. Send playwright notifications for new licensing purchases with detailed production information. Generate theater company receipts with licensing terms and script access instructions.

### Analytics and Reporting
Track payment conversion rates by licensing model and pricing tier. Generate playwright revenue reports with detailed breakdowns by script and theater company. Provide theater company spending analytics with budget tracking and forecasting capabilities.

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Payment Failure Management
Implement comprehensive error handling for declined cards, insufficient funds, and payment processing timeouts. Provide clear user feedback with actionable next steps for payment resolution. Maintain payment attempt logs for customer service and dispute resolution.

### Webhook Reliability
Ensure webhook endpoint reliability with proper error handling and retry mechanisms. Implement idempotency checks to prevent duplicate payment processing. Log all webhook events with detailed payload information for debugging and audit purposes.

### Data Consistency
Maintain payment and licensing data consistency across all system components with transaction rollback capabilities. Implement eventual consistency patterns for distributed payment processing. Support manual payment reconciliation tools for edge cases and system recovery scenarios.
