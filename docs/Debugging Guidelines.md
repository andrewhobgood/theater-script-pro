# Debugging Guidelines for TheaterScript Pro

## Overview

This guide establishes comprehensive debugging strategies for TheaterScript Pro's critical systems including payment processing, file access, authentication flows, and production issue resolution. Given the platform's handling of intellectual property and financial transactions, robust error handling and monitoring are essential for maintaining user trust and platform reliability.

## Error Handling Architecture

### Critical Error Categories

**Payment Processing Errors**
- Stripe webhook failures and retry logic
- Payment method validation and decline handling
- Subscription state inconsistencies
- Refund and chargeback processing

**File Access Errors**
- S3 presigned URL expiration and regeneration
- Script upload validation and virus scanning
- PDF viewer authentication and watermarking failures
- File corruption and backup recovery

**Authentication Flow Errors**
- OTP delivery failures and retry mechanisms
- Role-based permission violations
- Session management and token refresh
- Multi-factor authentication edge cases

**Data Integrity Errors**
- Supabase connection failures and retry logic
- Copyright registration status tracking
- Licensing agreement state management
- Analytics data validation and correction

## Sentry Integration Strategy

### Error Tracking Configuration

```
Error Monitoring Flow:
User Action → Application Error → Sentry Capture → Alert System → Resolution Tracking

1. Client-side errors (React components, form validation)
2. Server-side errors (API routes, database operations)
3. Payment processing errors (Stripe webhooks, transaction failures)
4. File system errors (S3 operations, PDF generation)
5. Authentication errors (Supabase auth, role validation)
```

### Context Enrichment

Capture essential context for each error type:
- User role and permissions level
- Script or licensing transaction ID
- Payment method and transaction state
- File access patterns and S3 bucket operations
- Authentication flow step and session state

### Alert Prioritization

**Critical (Immediate Response)**
- Payment processing failures affecting revenue
- Script access denied for valid licenses
- Authentication system downtime
- Copyright registration submission failures

**High (Within 2 hours)**
- File upload failures preventing script publishing
- Email delivery failures for OTP and notifications
- Search functionality degradation
- Profile page rendering errors

**Medium (Within 24 hours)**
- Analytics data collection issues
- Non-critical UI component failures
- Performance degradation alerts
- Third-party integration warnings

## Payment Processing Debugging

### Stripe Error Handling

Implement comprehensive error handling for payment flows:
- Card decline scenarios with user-friendly messaging
- Webhook signature validation and replay protection
- Subscription lifecycle event processing
- Dispute and chargeback notification handling

### Transaction State Management

Monitor and debug transaction state inconsistencies:
- Payment intent status tracking across user sessions
- License activation timing and confirmation
- Refund processing and script access revocation
- Educational pricing tier validation

### Revenue Protection

Establish safeguards against revenue loss:
- Duplicate payment prevention mechanisms
- Failed webhook retry logic with exponential backoff
- Manual reconciliation processes for edge cases
- Fraud detection and prevention workflows

## File Access Debugging

### S3 Operations Monitoring

Track and debug file system operations:
- Presigned URL generation and expiration handling
- Script upload validation and processing
- Backup and recovery verification
- Access control and permission inheritance

### PDF Viewer Security

Debug secure viewing functionality:
- Watermarking application and verification
- Download prevention and right-click protection
- Session-based access control validation
- Cross-origin resource sharing configuration

### Performance Optimization

Monitor and optimize file delivery:
- CDN cache hit rates and invalidation
- Large file upload progress tracking
- Concurrent access limitations
- Bandwidth usage and cost optimization

## Authentication Flow Debugging

### OTP and Email Delivery

Debug authentication communication:
- Resend integration monitoring and failover
- OTP generation and expiration tracking
- Email template rendering and delivery confirmation
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

### Role-Based Access Control

Validate permission systems:
- Role assignment and inheritance verification
- Resource-level access control testing
- Permission escalation prevention
- Cross-role data access validation

### Session Management

Monitor authentication state:
- Token refresh and expiration handling
- Multi-device session coordination
- Logout and session invalidation
- Concurrent session limitations

## Production Troubleshooting Workflows

### Incident Response Process

```
Incident Detection → Triage → Investigation → Resolution → Post-Mortem

1. Automated alert triggers from Sentry or monitoring
2. Severity assessment and team notification
3. Root cause analysis with context gathering
4. Fix implementation and verification
5. Documentation and prevention measures
```

### Debugging Toolchain

Utilize comprehensive debugging tools:
- Sentry error tracking and performance monitoring
- Vercel deployment logs and function insights
- Supabase database query analysis
- Stripe dashboard for payment investigation
- AWS CloudWatch for S3 operation monitoring

### Data Recovery Procedures

Establish recovery protocols:
- Database backup restoration procedures
- File system backup verification and recovery
- Payment transaction reconstruction
- User data export and import processes

## Logging Best Practices

### Structured Logging

Implement consistent logging across all systems:
- Standardized log levels and message formats
- Correlation IDs for cross-system request tracking
- Sensitive data redaction and privacy protection
- Performance metrics and timing information

### Log Retention and Analysis

Manage log data effectively:
- Retention policies for different log types
- Log aggregation and search capabilities
- Automated log analysis and pattern detection
- Compliance and audit trail maintenance

### Privacy and Security

Protect sensitive information in logs:
- PII redaction and anonymization
- Payment information exclusion
- Script content protection
- User behavior privacy preservation

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators

Monitor critical system metrics:
- API response times and error rates
- Database query performance and optimization
- File upload and download speeds
- Payment processing completion times
- User authentication success rates

### Alerting Thresholds

Set appropriate performance alerts:
- Response time degradation beyond user expectations
- Error rate increases indicating system issues
- Resource utilization approaching capacity limits
- Third-party service availability and performance

## Continuous Improvement

### Error Analysis and Prevention

Regularly analyze error patterns:
- Common user error scenarios and UX improvements
- System failure patterns and architectural changes
- Performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Security vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies

### Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

Maintain comprehensive debugging documentation:
