# Licensing & eCommerce Flow Standards

## Overview

The licensing system orchestrates the complete transaction lifecycle from script discovery to instant access, handling multiple pricing models, Stripe integration, and secure script delivery. This flow ensures playwrights maintain control over their intellectual property while providing theaters with seamless licensing experiences.

## System Architecture

```
Theater Company → Script Discovery → Pricing Selection → Checkout Flow
                                                            ↓
Playwright Dashboard ← License Notification ← Payment Processing
                                                            ↓
Script Access Portal ← Secure URL Generation ← Transaction Completion
```

## Core Components Structure

### API Route Organization
- `api/licensing` - handles pricing calculations, license validation, and access control
- `api/stripe` - manages webhooks, payment intents, and subscription handling  
- `api/checkout` - coordinates the complete purchase flow and script provisioning
- `api/scripts/access` - generates secure download URLs and manages access permissions

### Frontend Component Hierarchy
- `components/licensing/PricingSelector` - displays available pricing tiers with educational rates
- `components/licensing/CheckoutForm` - handles payment collection and license terms
- `components/licensing/AccessPortal` - provides post-purchase script access interface
- `components/licensing/TransactionHistory` - shows licensing history for both roles

## Pricing Model Implementation

### Multi-Tier Pricing Structure
Support playwright-defined pricing models including standard rates, educational discounts, and bulk licensing options. Each script maintains separate pricing configurations for different production types and audience sizes.

### Dynamic Pricing Calculation
```
Base Rate + Audience Modifier + Duration Modifier + Educational Discount = Final Price
```

Implement real-time price calculation based on production details, with transparent breakdown display during checkout. Handle edge cases like minimum fees and maximum caps per playwright preferences.

### Educational Rate Management
Provide automated educational discount application with verification requirements. Theater companies must provide educational credentials during registration, with ongoing validation for continued access to reduced rates.

## Checkout Flow Standards

### Multi-Step Checkout Process
1. **License Selection** - production details, performance dates, venue capacity
2. **Terms Agreement** - display playwright-specific licensing terms and restrictions
3. **Payment Processing** - Stripe integration with secure card handling
4. **Instant Provisioning** - immediate script access upon successful payment

### Form Validation Requirements
Use Zod schemas for comprehensive validation of production metadata, payment information, and licensing terms acceptance. Implement client-side validation with server-side verification for security.

### Error Handling Protocols
Provide clear error messaging for payment failures, invalid production details, and licensing conflicts. Implement retry mechanisms for temporary payment processing issues while maintaining transaction integrity.

## Stripe Integration Patterns

### Payment Intent Management
Create payment intents with detailed metadata including script ID, production details, and licensing terms. Handle payment confirmation with proper webhook validation and idempotency key usage.

### Webhook Processing
Implement robust webhook handlers for payment success, failure, and dispute events. Ensure proper signature verification and event deduplication to prevent duplicate script access grants.

### Subscription Handling
Support recurring payments for extended runs and subscription-based licensing models. Manage proration, upgrades, and cancellations with appropriate access control updates.

## Script Access Control

### Secure URL Generation
Generate time-limited, signed URLs for script downloads using AWS S3 presigned URLs. Implement proper expiration times and access logging for intellectual property protection.

### Access Permission Matrix
```
Role          | Full Script | Perusal | Production Materials | Analytics
Playwright    | ✓          | ✓       | ✓                   | ✓
Theater (Paid)| ✓          | ✓       | ✓                   | Limited
Theater (Free)| ✗          | ✓       | ✗                   | ✗
Admin         | ✓          | ✓       | ✓                   | ✓
```

### Download Tracking
Log all script access attempts with user identification, timestamp, and access type. Provide playwrights with detailed access analytics while respecting theater company privacy preferences.

## Transaction Management

### Order Processing Pipeline
1. **Validation** - verify script availability and pricing accuracy
2. **Payment** - process Stripe payment with proper error handling
3. **Provisioning** - grant script access and generate download URLs
4. **Notification** - send confirmation emails to both parties
5. **Analytics** - update licensing metrics and revenue tracking

### Transaction State Management
Maintain comprehensive transaction records including payment status, script access grants, and licensing terms. Implement proper state transitions with audit logging for compliance and dispute resolution.

### Refund and Dispute Handling
Provide clear refund policies with automated processing for qualifying scenarios. Implement dispute resolution workflows with proper documentation and communication channels.

## Notification System Integration

### Email Automation
Integrate with Resend for transactional emails including purchase confirmations, script access instructions, and licensing reminders. Use template-based messaging with personalization and tracking.

### Real-Time Updates
Implement WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time licensing notifications to playwright dashboards. Provide immediate feedback on new licenses, payment confirmations, and access grants.

### Reminder Scheduling
Schedule automated reminders for license renewals, production reporting deadlines, and payment due dates. Use intelligent scheduling based on production timelines and user behavior patterns.

## Security and Compliance

### Data Protection Standards
Encrypt all payment information and personally identifiable data. Implement proper data retention policies and deletion procedures for compliance with privacy regulations.

### Audit Trail Requirements
Maintain comprehensive audit logs for all licensing transactions, script access events, and payment processing activities. Ensure logs are immutable and properly secured for legal compliance.

### Fraud Prevention
Implement velocity limits, geographic restrictions, and suspicious activity detection for payment processing. Monitor for unusual licensing patterns and unauthorized access attempts.

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies
Cache pricing calculations, script metadata, and user permissions to reduce database load during high-traffic periods. Implement proper cache invalidation for pricing updates and access changes.

### Database Query Optimization
Optimize licensing queries for performance with proper indexing on script ID, user ID, and transaction status. Use connection pooling and query optimization for high-volume operations.

### CDN Integration
Leverage Vercel's CDN for static assets and implement proper caching headers for licensing pages. Ensure optimal performance for script discovery and checkout flows globally.
